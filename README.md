<p>This Interview Management System has been fully developed by using core Python with CLI mode, In this, I have used Postgres database </p>.

<p><b>This Interview management platform(system), it will manage all the interview without any use of paper, pen it will store
  all the information of applied candidates for job and Interview process.</p></b>

<ul>
  
  <li>➢ It mainly focusses on dealing and manage with the candidates regarding their
        interviews, create new job vacancies manage candidates, view their records and add
        candidates for further rounds etc.
  </li>

  <li>➢ After that, the user can simply head over to the question section where the admin
        can add and manage questions by entering interview questions.
  </li>
  
</ul>

   user interface for the admin and candidates. The admin can log in to their account.
